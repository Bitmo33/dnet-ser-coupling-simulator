Reference simulator for the SER (Settlement–Exchange–Record) coupling model described in the DNET® architecture paper.

# DNET® SER Coupling Simulator

This repository contains a conceptual simulator based on the  
SER (Settlement–Exchange–Record) coupling model described in the DNET® architecture paper.

## Overview

The simulator demonstrates a coupled transaction lifecycle in which:

Settlement (S)  
Exchange (E)  
Record generation (R)  

are treated as parts of a single transaction state linked by a common transaction identifier (TxID).

The demo illustrates both:

- a successful SER-coupled finalization  
- a failure / rollback path when one stage does not complete  

## SER Coupling Model

A digital payment event is defined as a coupled transaction state:

SER(TxID) = S(TxID) ∧ E(TxID) ∧ R(TxID)

Settlement, exchange, and record generation must complete under a single transaction identifier  
to form a valid payment state.

## Purpose

This repository is intended as a reference-style research demo accompanying the DNET® paper.

It is designed to help visualize:

- TxID-centered lifecycle coupling  
- transaction-state consistency  
- rollback handling under partial failure  
- compliance-ready record generation  

## Notes

This is a conceptual simulator, not a production payment system.  
It is provided for research, demonstration, and explanatory purposes.  

The simulator is aligned with the theoretical SER coupling model described in the paper  
and does not claim exclusivity or production completeness.

This repository serves as a reference-style conceptual implementation  
for the SER coupling architecture described in the DNET® paper.

This repository provides a simplified simulator that helps illustrate  
the transaction lifecycle described in that framework.
