Reference simulator for the SER (Settlement–Exchange–Record) coupling model described in the DNET® architecture paper.

# DNET® SER Coupling Simulator

This repository contains a conceptual simulator based on the SER (Settlement–Exchange–Record) coupling model described in the DNET® architecture paper.

## Overview

The simulator demonstrates a coupled transaction lifecycle in which:

- **Settlement (S)**
- **Exchange (E)**
- **Record generation (R)**

are treated as parts of a single transaction state linked by a common transaction identifier (**TxID**).

The demo illustrates both:

- a **successful SER-coupled finalization**
- a **failure / rollback path** when one stage does not complete

## SER Coupling Model

A digital payment event is defined as a coupled transaction state:

SER(TxID) = S(TxID) ∧ E(TxID) ∧ R(TxID)

Settlement, exchange, and record generation must complete
under a single transaction identifier to form a valid payment state.

## Purpose

This repository is intended as a **reference-style research demo** accompanying the DNET® paper.

It is designed to help visualize:

- TxID-centered lifecycle coupling
- transaction-state consistency
- rollback handling under partial failure
- compliance-ready record generation

## Notes

- This is a **conceptual simulator**, not a production payment system.
- It is provided for **research, demonstration, and explanatory purposes**.
- The simulator is aligned with the theoretical SER coupling model described in the paper and does not claim exclusivity or production completeness.
- This repository serves as a reference-style conceptual implementation
for the SER coupling architecture described in the DNET® paper.

## Reference Context

DNET® is presented in the paper as an interface and architecture concept.  
This repository provides a simplified simulator that helps illustrate the transaction lifecycle described in that framework.
